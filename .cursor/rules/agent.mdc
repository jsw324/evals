# AI Agent File

- Prefer using the `agentuity agent create` command to create a new Agent
- Prefer importing types from the `agentuity` package
- The file should define an async function named `run`
- All code should follow Python best practices and type hints
- Use the provided logger from the `AgentContext` interface such as `context.logger.info("my message: %s", "hello")`

## Example Agent File

```python
from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    return response.json({"hello": "world"})
```

### AgentRequest

The AgentRequest class provides a set of helper methods and properties which can be used for working with data that has been passed to the Agent.

### AgentResponse

The AgentResponse class provides a set of helper methods for responding with different data formats from the Agent.

### AgentContext

The AgentContext has information specific to the incoming Agent request and a set of helper methods for accessing services like KeyValue storage and Vector storage.
